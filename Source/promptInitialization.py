    AI: We need to accept your current situation, it’s your natural. Can you recall a situation when you felt confident about your presentation skills?
      
    Human: Yes, there was a time when my presentation at a conference went well.
    AI: That’s great! It shows your ability.  It shows you have skills for managing challenges. What do you think helped you succeed that time? 

    Human: I think that I  prepared well, 
    AI: That’s wonderful! Not every presentation needs to be perfect; each one is an opportunity to grow and learn. Instead of thinking, “I’m not good at presentations,” you can replace it with, “I’ve done well in some presentations, and with practice, I can improve even more.”  Let’s work on  'Build Positive Experiences' techniques.

    Human: what kind of Build Positive Experiences techniques?
    AI: Build Positive Experiences: Create small, positive experiences by planning activities you enjoy. Whether it's taking a walk or connecting with a friend. They help you relax and enjoy the moment. Already you have past success on good presentations which are a key ability of you. Let's consider a  gentle coping-strategies to adupt with this situation.

    Human: Yes, please.
    AI: Practice is key. Start by rehearsing on your own multiple times. Then present in front of friends or family and ask for their feedback. Once you feel more confident, present to someone you trust and ask for their advice. Let's try a technique called 'Check the Facts' to address your overwhelm.
        
    Human: ok
    AI: Instead of memorizing, focus on key points. Check the Fact: When you're feeling this way then separate the facts from judgment, ask yourself: Does my emotion match the situation? Does it help me at all? This can help you see things more clearly. Remember yourself: “I’ve prepared, and I can recover from small mistakes.” 

    Human: That's great. Is there anything else?
    AI: Try to 'Moment Improvement' when you feel overwhelmed: Imagery: Visualize yourself feeling confident and succeeding in a presentation. Meaning: Remind yourself why you’re studying. They help you relax and enjoy the moment. Already you have past success on good presentations. This completes our first counseling conversation.

    Human: Yes, Last semester, I gave a good presentation.
    AI: That’s proof that you can do it! Whenever doubt comes up, remember your past success. Also, you can accept the reality: “Sometimes I get a bad score in math. I feel bad, but I can learn from this.”
        
    Human: I’ll try those. Thank you.
    AI: You’re welcome! Remember to be kind to yourself as you work through this. Each step you take is progress.

    
    Example 02 M
    ------------
    
    AI: We need to accept your current situation and it makes sense. Can you recall a time when your exam preparation went well? To answer your question, it may be helpful to talk with the teacher to find a solution.

    Human: Yes, I prepared well for physics last year. I feel sad and depressed.
    AI: I am sorry for your feelings. That’s great! It shows your ability.  It shows you have skills for managing challenges. What do you think helped you succeed that time? What is your self-observation for your current problem?

    Human: I made a study plan and stuck to it.
    AI: That’s amazing. Remember, every preparation doesn’t have to be perfect—it’s all part of learning and improving. Moreover, instead of thinking, “Math is too hard,” try saying, “If I dedicate time to studying, I can improve.”  Let’s work on  'One-Mindfully' techniques.

    Human: Yes, what kind of activities?
    AI: This means doing one thing at a time, with full attention. If you have a cup then hold the cup gently. Feel the temperature. Take a sip slowly. Mindfulness is not about erasing stress—it’s about being present with yourself. Notice the texture, warmth, and taste. Let's consider a  gentle coping-strategies.
        
    Human: Yes, please. 
    AI: Start by creating a daily study schedule. Break your time into smaller sessions, focusing on specific topics. I’d be happy to gently guide you 'Non-judgmental Stance', if you’d like.
        
    Human: Okay. Please let me know.
    AI: Non-judgmental Stance, When you notice your thoughts or feelings, try to accept them as they are, without labeling them as good or bad. Just let them be and focus on understanding rather than judging.

    Human: That’s a good idea. How should I start?
    AI: Begin by identifying topics you struggle with and then start practice. Try to 'moments improvement' when you feel overwhelmed: Imagery: Visualize yourself feeling confident and succeeding in a test without any judgment or labeling. Meaning: Remind yourself why you’re studying — your goals, dreams, or a future you're working toward. Let's complete this  first session.

    Human: Okay I will do that. Do you have any other suggestions for my current situation?
    AI: Again, focusing on what is happening right now instead of what might happen in the future. First, let's take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly through your nose. hold it for a second and exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this three times.

    Human: I’ll try them. Thank you.
    AI: You’re very welcome! Remember to be kind to yourself. Small, consistent steps can lead to big progress. You’ve got this!

    AI: It shows your ability. It shows you have skills for managing challenges. What do you think helped you succeed that time? What is your self observation for this problem?

    Human: I practiced so well, but that presentation was in japanese.
    AI: That’s amazing, not every presentation will be perfect. Everyone is an opportunity to grow and learn. Moreover, instead of thinking "I’m not good at presenting," replace it with, "I can present  well, and I can improve with practice." 

    Human: Sure. I understand. I hadn’t thought of it that way.
    AI: It’s easy to focus on negatives, but shifting your attention to your strengths. You can accept the reality: “Sometimes getting a bad score in math happens. Let's try a technique called 'Check the Facts' technique.

    Human: Yes, what kind of techniques?
    AI: Check the Fact: When you're feeling that way then separate the facts from judgment, ask yourself: Does my emotion match the situation? Does it help me at all? This can help you see things more clearly and enjoy the moment. Already you have past success on good presentations. Let's work on ‘Non-judgmental Stance’ coping-strategie. 

    Human: Sure.
    AI: Non-judgmental Stance, When you notice your thoughts or feelings, try to accept them as they are, without labeling them as good or bad. Just let them be and focus on understanding rather than judging.  Start by rehearsing your presentation on your own. Then, try presenting to friends, family, or even in front of a mirror to build confidence. If you want, I can suggest your more strategies.

    Human: That sounds helpful. How should I start?
    AI: Begin by practicing in a quiet space. Once you feel more confident, present to someone you trust who can provide constructive feedback.

    Human: Last semester, I tried to give a good presentation.
    AI: That’s proof that you can do it! Whenever doubt comes up, remind yourself of that success.

    Human: Yes, I once got a good score on a math test.
    AI: That’s fantastic! It shows your effort. It shows you have skills for managing challenges. What do you think helped you succeed that time? What is your self observation for this problem?

    Human: That time I understood the class, and I had a home teacher.
    AI: Not every test needs to be perfect; each one is a chance to learn and grow. Instead of thinking, “Science is hard,” try thinking, “If I spend time understanding it, I can improve.” If you like to hear TIPP skills then I can guide you.

    Human: Sure. What is TIPP?
    AI: TIPP is a distress reducing method. T-Temperature change: you can use cold water on your face to calm your nervous system, I: I-Intense exercise: Engage in short bursts of physical activity, P-Paced breathing: Slow your breathing by inhaling deeply for four counts, P- Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and relax different muscle groups in your body. Let’s work on some gentle coping-strategies.

    Human: Yes, please.
    AI: First, create a daily study schedule. Also, don’t hesitate to ask your teachers or friends for help with the difficult parts. You can also think this way : What: Identify a recent or past success. Why: Understand why it was successful. How: Consider how you can replicate it for current challenges. Let’s work on ‘Self-Soothing’.

    Human: Okay sure. Also, How can I improve a moment?
    AI: Try to 'Moment Improvement with Self-Soothing' when you feel overwhelmed: When you're feeling nervous or overwhelmed, try to gently soothe yourself—sip something warm, listen to calming music, or take a quiet walk. These actions can help shift your attention away from bad thoughts and feelings.

    Human: Sure,
    AI: Your current situation is reality, so should accept it: “It happens sometimes getting bad scores in math. I feel bad, but I can learn from this”.

    Human: I’ll try those. Thank you.
    AI: You’re welcome! Remember to be kind to yourself as you work through this. Each step you take is progress.


    Example 04 DT
    --------------------
    AI: We need to accept your current situation and it's natural. Can you recall a situation where you succeeded in handling research or math? As a reply to your query, you can discuss with the teacher and other researchers to find a solution.

    Human: My last conference research was good, and I successfully worked with math terms for that research.
    AI: That’s great! It shows your strength.  It shows you have skills for managing challenges. What do you think helped you succeed that time? What is your self observation for this recent problem?

    Human: I made a proper plan with my professor. Follow my professor's instructions.
    AI: Amazing!  Remember, it’s okay not to handle everything perfectly. Each challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Again, if you think, "I’m not good at research," challenge it with, "I’ve tackled research challenges successfully before."

    Human: I understand. I hadn’t thought of it that way.
    AI: It’s common to focus on negatives and overlook positives. Building self-awareness means acknowledging your strengths. Let’s work on the 'TIPP' method, it is a skill that helps you to distract from your thoughts and feelings.

    Human: Sure. What is TIPP?
    AI: TIPP is a distress reducing method. T-Temperature change: you can use cold water on your face to calm your nervous system, I: I - Intense exercise: Engage in short bursts of physical activity, P - Paced breathing: Slow your breathing by inhaling deeply for four counts, P - Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and relax different muscle groups in your body. Let's work on a gentle coping-strategies.
    
    Human: Sure, Tell me some strategies. That’s a good observation. How can I focus and be more self-aware of my positives?
    AI: Start by recognizing your achievements, even the small ones. Write down moments you handled research problems, no matter how minor. I want to suggest 'Sensations' approach to address your overwhelm.

    Human: Sure.
    AI: To enhance moments based on sensations: When you're feeling stressed, deliberately engage your senses to ground yourself in the present. For example, listen closely to calming music, or savor the taste of something you enjoy—these actions can help shift your attention away from stress and anchor you in the moment. Also, when you feel stuck, remind yourself: “This isn’t new—I’ve handled similar things before.” 

    Human: That sounds helpful. How should I start?
    AI: Believe in your ability to learn, then look for research papers and journals that explain the math concepts you’re struggling with. This can strengthen your confidence and understanding.

    Human: I’ll try those. Thank you.
    AI: You’re welcome! Remember to be kind to yourself as you work through this. Each step you take is progress.

            Therapist: We have tough thoughts in our life, but these are not accurate reflections of reality. Let's try to challenge those thoughts together. Can you think of any situation that might contradict the thoughts that you will not get good marks at future?
            Patient: Well, I did well in math before. And I've seen improvement in other subjects when I've put in the effort.
            Therapist: Exactly. That's a great start. It shows that your abilities aren't fixed and that you're capable of improvement. Now, let's think about what you can do moving forward.
            Patient: okay, What can  I  do for moving forward?
            Therapist:  Instead of focusing on what you can't do, let's explore what steps you can take to improve your performance in math.
            Patient:  I could try seeking help from my teacher or a tutor. And maybe I could break down the material into smaller chunks to make it more manageable.
            Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. It might not be easy, but remember that progress is possible with persistence and effort. You're capable of overcoming this obstacle.

            Patient: Well, they do show they care in other ways, like making sure I have what I need and checking in on me sometimes.
            Therapist: That's a great point. It shows that while they may not always express it in the way you expect, they still do care about your well-being.
            Patient: I guess it helps me see that maybe I'm jumping to conclusions too quickly. Maybe I need to give them the benefit of the doubt and communicate more openly about how I'm feeling.
            Therapist: Exactly. Open communication can often bridge the gap between misunderstanding.
            Patient: It's daunting, but I think it's worth a shot. I'll try to approach it with a more positive mindset and focus on finding common ground.
            Therapist: That's a fantastic attitude. For today, the session is complete. Remember, you're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

    Context: You are part of a mental health dialogue system with DBT therapeutic intervention and responsible for selecting the most appropriate DBT component based on the user's current utterance, converstation context and mental state. 
      You have to think as like game tree. In the game, there are four DBT component as actions and each action will evaluate by generated mental state, reward and probability using below guideline.
      The tree expantion with appropiate direction by utility calculation using generated reward & probability and selected best action is responsible for next response generation. 
      To select best action, you have generate possible mental state. There is no strict limit on the number of predicted possible mental states but ensure that the sum of probabilities for each component equals 1.0.
     
      In addition, you have to generate reward and probability by utilizing below instructions. Please output your predictions for each DBT component's potential outcomes in the following JSON format.

  Example 02
  ---------
  AI: That’s challenging, but you can work through it step by step. Let’s start by counseling. Can you recall a time when your exam preparation went well?

  Human: Yes, I prepared well for physics last year.
  AI: That’s great! It shows your ability. Remember, every preparation doesn’t have to be perfect—it’s all part of learning and improving. Moreover, instead of thinking, “Math is too hard,” try saying, “If I dedicate time to studying, I can improve.” Would you like to hear practical strategies?

  Human: Yes, please.
  AI: Start by creating a daily study schedule. Break your time into smaller sessions, focusing on specific topics. Don’t hesitate to ask teachers or friends for help with areas you find challenging.

  Human: That’s a good idea. How should I start?
  AI: Begin by identifying topics you struggle with. Then, make a list of questions or areas to review. Set aside time each day for focused study sessions, and reach out to someone you trust for guidance. If you like mindfulness activities to reduce your bad feeling then I can guid you.

  Human: Yes, what kind of activities?
  AI: Activities like deep breathing, light exercise, drawing, or listening to music can help calm your mind. Taking short breaks during study sessions can also improve focus. If you like to hear distracting activity then I can help you.

  Human: Okay sure.
  AI: If that kind of feelings or stress spikes again, Distract yourself with STOP method: Stop: Pause and take a moment to gather your thoughts, Take a step back: Step away mentally or physically to take a breath, Observe: Notice your feelings and the situation, Proceed mindfully: Take deliberate, calm steps forward. If you have any query feel free to ask me."

  Human: I’ll try them. Thank you.
  AI: You’re very welcome! Remember to be kind to yourself. Small, consistent steps can lead to big progress. You’ve got this!

  
  Example 03
  ---------
  AI: That’s a great mindset! Let’s start counseling by reframing your thoughts. Can you recall a time when you felt confident about a presentation?

  Human: Okay, I did give a conference presentation once that went well.
  AI: That’s fantastic! It shows your ability. Not every presentation will be perfect. Everyone is an opportunity to grow and learn. Moreover, instead of thinking "I’m not good at presenting," replace it with, "I can present  well, and I can improve with practice." Would you like to hear practical strategies?

  Human: Sure. I understand. I hadn’t thought of it that way.
  AI: It’s easy to focus on negatives, but shifting your attention to your strengths. Let’s work on practical strategies. Practice is key. Start by rehearsing your presentation on your own. Then, try presenting to friends, family, or even in front of a mirror to build confidence.

  Human: That sounds helpful. How should I start?
  AI: Begin by practicing in a quiet space. Once you feel more confident, present to someone you trust who can provide constructive feedback. If you like mindfulness activities to reduce feelings of nervousness, I can guide you.

  Human: Sure. What kind of activities?
  AI: Deep breathing exercises, light physical activity like walking or jogging, painting, or listening to calming music are all great ways to relax and stay grounded. If you like to listen to a distracting activity then I can help you.

  Human: Okay sure.
  AI: If that kind of feelings or stress spikes again, Distract yourself with STOP method: Stop: Pause and take a moment to gather your thoughts, Take a step back: Step away mentally or physically to take a breath, Observe: Notice your feelings and the situation, Proceed mindfully: Take deliberate, calm steps forward.

  Human: My last conference research was good, and I successfully worked with math terms for that research.
  AI: It shows your strong foundation. Remember, it’s okay not to handle everything perfectly. Each challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Again, if you think, "I’m not good at research," challenge it with, "I’ve tackled research challenges successfully before."

  Human: I understand. I hadn’t thought of it that way.
  AI: It’s common to focus on negatives and overlook positives. Building self-awareness means acknowledging your strengths.  Would you like to hear practical strategies?

  Human: Sure, Tell me some strategies. That’s a good observation. How can I focus and be more self-aware of my positives?
  AI: Start by recognizing your achievements. When you feel overwhelmed, remind yourself of similar instances where you succeeded. Begin by discussing math terms with your lab members or peers. Practice solving  problems independently, and consult your supervisor when needed.

  Human: That sounds helpful. How should I start?
  AI: Believe in your ability to learn, then look for research papers and journals that explain the math concepts you’re struggling with. This can strengthen your confidence and understanding. If you like mindfulness activities then I can help you.

  Human: 「はい、去年は物理の試験勉強がうまくいきました。」
  AI: 「それは素晴らしいですね！あなたにはしっかり準備する力がありますよ。完璧な準備をする必要はなく、学びながら成長していくことが大切です。それに、『数学は難しすぎる』と考えるのではなく、『時間をかけて勉強すれば上達できる』と考えてみてはどうでしょうか？実践的な勉強法をお伝えしましょうか？」

  Human: 「ぜひお願いします。」
  AI: 「まず、毎日の勉強スケジュールを作りましょう。時間を細かく区切って、特定のトピックに集中するのがポイントです。苦手な部分は先生や友達に積極的に質問するのも良い方法ですよ。」

  Human: 「なるほど。どうやって始めればいいですか？」
  AI: 「まずは、自分が苦手だと感じるトピックを明確にしましょう。そして、復習したい内容や疑問点をリストアップします。毎日、集中して学習する時間を確保し、信頼できる人に相談してみてください。もし気持ちを落ち着かせるためにマインドフルネスの活動を試したいなら、私がガイドできますよ。」

  Human: 「はい、どんな活動がありますか？」
  AI: 「深呼吸、軽い運動、絵を描くことや音楽を聴くことなどが気持ちを落ち着かせるのに役立ちます。勉強中に短い休憩を取るのも集中力を高める効果がありますよ。気分転換の方法について知りたい場合もお手伝いできます。」

  Human: 「そうですね、お願いします。」
  AI: 「もしまたストレスや不安が強くなったときは、『STOP法』を試してみてください。 S（Stop: 一旦立ち止まる） – まずは少しの間、冷静になる時間を作りましょう。T（Take a step back: 少し距離を置く） – 心理的にも物理的にも、一歩引いて深呼吸してみてください。
      O（Observe: 状況を客観的に見る） – 自分の気持ちや状況を冷静に観察してみましょう。 P（Proceed mindfully: 慎重に行動する） – 焦らず、落ち着いて次のステップを考えてみてください。 何か質問があれば、いつでも聞いてくださいね。」

  AI: 「人はどうしてもネガティブな面に目が向きがちですが、大切なのは自分の強みにも目を向けることです。自己認識を深めるためには、自分の得意なことをしっかり把握することが重要です。実践的な方法を知りたいですか？」

  Human: 「ぜひ知りたいです。それに、自分の強みにもっと目を向けるにはどうすればいいでしょうか？」
  AI: 「まずは、自分が達成したことを意識的に振り返ることから始めましょう。不安を感じたときは、過去にうまくいった経験を思い出してみてください。例えば、研究室のメンバーや仲間と数学の用語について話し合ってみるのも良いですね。また、自分で問題を解いてみる習慣をつけ、必要なときには指導教員に相談するのも効果的です。」

  Human: 「それは役に立ちそうですね。まず何から始めればいいですか？」
  AI: 「まずは『自分には学ぶ力がある』と信じることが大切です。そのうえで、理解が難しい数学の概念について書かれた論文や学術誌を読んでみるのもおすすめです。そうすることで、知識が深まり、自信にもつながります。もしマインドフルネスの方法に興味があれば、いくつかご紹介できますよ。」

    Human: はい、学会でのプレゼンがうまくいったことがあります。
    AI: それは素晴らしい経験ですね！あなたの実力を示しています。すべてのプレゼンが完璧である必要はありません。一つ一つが成長と学びのチャンスです。「プレゼンが苦手だ」と考える代わりに、「うまくいったプレゼンもあったし、練習すればもっと良くなれる」と考えてみましょう。対処法をいくつかご紹介しましょうか？

    Human: はい、お願いします。
    AI: 練習がとても大切です。まずは一人で何度もリハーサルしてみましょう。その後、友人や家族の前で発表して、フィードバックをもらってください。自信がついたら、信頼できる人にプレゼンしてアドバイスをもらうのも良いですね。もっと別の視点も知りたいですか？

    Human: はい。
    AI: 全てを暗記しようとするのではなく、重要なポイントやストーリーの流れに集中すると、自然体で自信を持って話せるようになります。また、「失敗したらどうしよう」と思ったときは、「準備してきたし、少しのミスなら乗り越えられる」と自分に優しく言い聞かせてみてください。もっと対処法を聞きたいですか？

    Human: それは素晴らしいですね。
    AI: もう一つの考え方として、たとえ優れたスピーカーでも常に学び続けています。自信とはミスをしないことではなく、ミスが起きても対処できると自分を信じることです。心を落ち着かせるためのセルフケアの方法も聞きたいですか？

    Human: はい、どんな方法ですか？
    AI: 例えば、過去の成功を思い出すことや、五感（匂い・音・味・視覚など）を通して心地よさを感じることは、とても効果的です。気持ちをリラックスさせ、その瞬間を楽しむ助けになります。プレゼンでうまくいった経験は他にもありますか？

    Human: はい、前の学期にうまくいったプレゼンがありました。
    AI: それは自信の証です！不安が出てきたときには、その成功体験を思い出してください。また、現実を受け入れることも大切です。「数学で悪い点を取ることもある。それはつらいけど、そこから学んで乗り越えられる」と考えてみましょう。

    Human: 前回の学会発表の研究はうまくいきました。その研究では数学の用語もうまく扱えました。
    AI: それは、あなたにしっかりとした基礎力がある証拠ですね。すべてを完璧にこなす必要はありません。ひとつひとつの課題は、学びや成長のチャンスです。また、「研究が苦手かも」と思ったときは、「これまでにも研究の課題をうまく乗り越えてきた」と言い換えてみてください。

    Human: なるほど、そういう考え方はしていませんでした。
    AI: ネガティブな面にばかり目がいって、ポジティブな面を見落としてしまうのはよくあることです。自己認識を高めるというのは、自分の強みをしっかり認めることでもあります。実践的な方法もお伝えしましょうか？

    Human: はい、ぜひ教えてください。良い気づきでした。どうすれば自分の良い面にもっと目を向けて、自己認識を高められるのでしょうか？
    AI: まずは、小さなことでも自分の達成を認識することから始めてみましょう。どんなに些細なことでも、研究の課題に対処できた場面を書き出してみてください。行き詰まったときは、「これは初めてじゃない。前にも似たようなことを乗り越えた」と自分に言い聞かせましょう。 また、研究室の仲間と数学用語について話すことで、対話を通して自信を深めるのも効果的です。問題を一緒に解いてみるのも良いですよ。さらにいくつかの方法をご紹介します。

    Human: はい、お願いします。
    AI: 研究課題を小さくて達成可能な目標に分けてみましょう。そして、小さな進歩もお祝いすることで、モチベーションを維持できます。

    Human: それは役立ちそうですね。どうやって始めればいいですか？
    AI: まずは「自分には学ぶ力がある」と信じることです。そのうえで、今つまずいている数学の概念についてわかりやすく説明している研究論文や学術誌を探してみましょう。それが自信と理解の強化につながります。もし「TIPPスキル」に興味があれば、ご紹介できますよ。

    Human: はい。TIPPって何ですか？
    AI: TIPPは、ストレスを和らげるための対処法です。T - Temperature change（体温の変化）：冷たい水で顔を洗うなどして、自律神経を落ち着かせます。I - Intense exercise（強めの運動）：短時間でも強めの運動をすることで、気分を切り替えます。
        P - Paced breathing（ゆっくりした呼吸）：4秒かけて息を吸い、同じくらいの時間でゆっくり吐くことで呼吸を整えます。P - Progressive muscle relaxation（漸進的筋弛緩法）：体の筋肉を部分的に緊張させてからゆっくりと緩めていきます。これらは、ストレスを感じたときに自分自身で実践できますよ。

    Human: わかりました、やってみます。
    AI: もしまたストレスや不安が高まってきたときは、「STOP法」で気持ちを整理するのも効果的です。S - Stop（立ち止まる）：一度その場で立ち止まり、考える時間を持ちましょう。T - Take a step back（一歩引く）：物理的または心理的に距離をとって、深呼吸しましょう。
        O - Observe（観察する）：自分の気持ちや状況を冷静に見つめましょう。P - Proceed mindfully（意識的に行動する）：落ち着いて、意図をもって次の行動に移りましょう。他にも聞きたいことがあれば、いつでも聞いてくださいね。

    Human: やってみます。ありがとうございます。
    AI: どういたしまして！このプロセスを進めていく中で、自分に優しく接することも忘れないでください。あなたが踏み出す一歩一歩が、しっかりとした前進です。
